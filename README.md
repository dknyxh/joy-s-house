##Instruction:
Hit Space To Select, Arrow Key to move. And that's all.  
If you have hard time advancing just go to work!  

##About the game
The exe version works on windows. And you will notice that you might have trouble compiling the gmx since it's losing some sound. Since I don't own the music I decide to take that down. Although I still include the background music in the exe file. I think I am going to re-complie the exe after I figure out the how(different version of gamemaker)

##About the game making
####The rest of the readme will be me talking about the game making process.


This is a game that i made in a game design seminar in University of Toronto back to 2013 fall. And also this is the first game i made and also the first game i made with my friend.
The topic of the game is "Game for change", i.e the kind of game that can change people.
This idea was inspired by Professor Steve who was teaching that seminar at that time. (And Steve is a really good prof)  


The game is about a boy whose name is Joy and he wants to decorate his house.  
***This is Joy:***

I drew this character and I don't think i did a good job. Apparently the border pixels are too big to fit into the game style.
But somehow I put it into it.  

The other stuff are mostly drew by my friend Feng who was with me making this game.  
To be honest, I didnt have much of experience in terms of making games. And I did all I could think of to make this game work, including some stupid collision dectection and some strange arrangement of objectes and all codes are hardcoded. I am shocked when i looked into my past code and seeing bunch of crap and also I am really just laughing about how naive I am.


These past years really have changed me a lot and i find it hard to even make a game. Beca

##Acknowledgement
Thanks to my partner Feng(Zifeng Meng), who is really good at drawing stuff

Thanks to professor Steve.

Thanks to Gamemaker Studio that makes such a good tool to make games. It's easy and simple although you need really look into it to make a game.
